########################
##### DEPENDENCIES #####
########################

Linux Ubuntu and Mac OSX
------------------------
	If PIL library is not installed, use the instructions in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20060096/installing-pil-with-pip.	

	### WARNING ###
	In Mac OSX, the GUI interface that displays images might crash Python. This code is tested on Linux Ubuntu 12.04.5 LTS and Linux Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS. The program ran successfully on both these platforms.

#####################################
##### STEPS TO USE THE SOFTWARE #####
#####################################

TO RUN THE PROGRAM: python main.py 		#### Command on the terminal

### WARNING ###
Sometimes, when this command is run, a huge line of warnings can appear. But, close the program and re-run it.

IMPORTANT:ONLY ONE FEATURE CAN BE USED IN A SINGLE RUN OF THE SOFTWARE. TO REUSE ANY FEATURE, THE PROGRAM HAS TO BE RE-RUN.

When the program is started, a simple GUI with four options will appear.
	Option 1: University Crime Explorer
	Option 2: Universities Comparer
	Option 3: Category Wise Crime
	Option 4: Crime Comparisons

The user has to choose one of the four following options. 

Option 1: University Crime Explorer
-----------------------------------
This is an interface to choose a particular university of interest. There are 10,615 university campus details in the dataset.

INPUT: 
	The input type for this interface is strictly text. The university name has to be entered without any spelling mistake. The case can be anything. But, there has to be only one space between the words in the university name. If an invalid input is entered by the user, the interface displays the appropriate message. When correct input is entered, the interface provides a dropdown to choose the branch of the university. 

	### WARNING ###
	When invalid inputs are entered at the beginning of the program, the error message persists on the interface. But, if the interface takes you to the stage where you are asked to choose the branch, then you can be assured of a result. DON'T WORRY ABOUT THE ERROR MESSAGE AS LONG AS YOU CAN GET TO THE STAGE TO SELECT BRANCH.

OUTPUT:
	An interface will appear with 2 images in it. One is a bar graph of number of crimes per student for each crime over the years 2010, 2011, 2012 in that particular university. The other is a Pie chart of the average rate of crimes in that university over time the same three years mentioned above.


Option 2: Universities Comparer
-------------------------------
This is an interface to choose two universities of interest to the user. 


INPUT:
	The input type for this interface is strictly text and the same conditions as above on the query should be followed for a correct output. As the names of both universities are entered, the interface will ask for the specific branch and the user has to choose the specific branch. After the branches are chosen, press the Search button.

OUTPUT:
	An interface will appear with 2 images each pertaining to the universities being compared and a button, VIEW NEXT RESULT. Click on the VIEW NEXT RESULT button to view the Pie Chart of the two universities together. 


Option 3: Category Wise Crime
-----------------------------
This is an interface to learn about the crimes pertaining to different categories. The two important categories in the dataset, State and Sector, are presented to the user and the user can choose any one of them.

INPUT:
	The user first chooses the category of interest: State or Sector. After the user presses the button, another drop down list containing the possible list of entities in each category is presented. The user has to choose an entity from that list and press the Search button. 

OUTPUT:
	The crime details pertaining to the entity belonging to the sector chosen is presented to the user in the form of a bar graph.


Option 4: Crime Comparisons
---------------------------
This is an interface to explore the various observations of two crimes across the categories: State and Sector

INPUT:
	The user is provided with two drop down lists mentioning the crimes that are present in the dataset. After choosing the two crimes, press Search button.

OUTPUT:
	Two plots of the crime comparisons with respect to each category (State and Sector) is presented to the user.
